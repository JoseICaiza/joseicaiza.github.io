I am a third-year PhD student in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, co-advised by [Prof. Philip E. Paré](https://sites.google.com/view/philpare) and [Prof. Junjie Qin](https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/junjie.qin.1). I received a MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University and a BSc in Electrical Engineering from Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral in Guayaquil, Ecuador.

My research focuses on the distributed optimization of networked dynamical systems under uncertainty, with applications in supply chains, power systems and epidemic processes. 

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.  -->
